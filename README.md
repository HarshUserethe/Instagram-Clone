# Instagram Clone 
This Instagram clone is a responsive web application that is modeled after the popular social media platform, Instagram. The clone is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and mimics many of the same features and functionality of the Instagram app. With this clone, users can upload photos, apply filters, add captions, and share their photos with friends and followers.
